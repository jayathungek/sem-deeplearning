    "# 1. Numpy \n",
    "Numpy is a powerful Python module that should be in the toolbelt of any AI/Deep learning practitioner. It provides functions and data structures that allow fast, efficient manipulation of mathematical structures like matrices and vectors. It represents these structures internally using Numpy arrays, which are like Python Lists, but highly optimised for calculations on large amounts of numerical data. Let's import this module now.\n",

    "Numpy arrays are almost the exact same as Pytorch Tensors, which you will have heard about by now. The only difference is that Pytorch Tensors can be operated on by the GPU; Numpy array operations are always performed by the CPU.  "

This allows you to define the number of dimensions that the structure represented by the array has. For example, the array `np_from_list` that we have just defined is just a flat list of numbers at the moment. `reshape` helps us represent it as a 2D data structure (a matrix). Keep in mind that the shape that you put into this method must agree with the number of elements in the array. In our example, the array has 10 elements, so acceptable shapes include:\n",
